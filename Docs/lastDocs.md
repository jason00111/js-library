# Last

## Function Description
Gets the last element of an array.


## Function Technical Explanation
Last is a function that will determine the last element of an array and present it in our result.

In order to achieve this, we first determine if the input is not an array or not a string. If the element is a string, we then split it into an empty string.  

If the element is an empty array, we return undefined as the result.

The final result is the last element of the array.
